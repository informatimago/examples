The =Makefile= contains rules to build the client and the server using
the CL implementations ccl, ecl, sbcl or clisp that are found on the
system.  The following executables may be built:

#+BEGIN_SRC
	client-lisp-ccl
	server-lisp-ccl
	client-lisp-ecl
	server-lisp-ecl
	client-lisp-sbcl
	server-lisp-sbcl
	client-lisp-clisp
	server-lisp-clisp
#+END_SRC

* Execution

Run a server in one terminal or emacs shell and a client in another.
The socket address localhost:3270 is hardwired.

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC
xterm -e sudo tcpdump -n -X -vv -i lo0 port 3270 &
sleep 1 ; xterm -e ./server-lisp-ccl &
sleep 1 ; xterm -e ./client-lisp-ccl &
#+END_SRC
